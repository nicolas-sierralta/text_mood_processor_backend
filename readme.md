# Text Mood Processor

The **Text Mood Processor** is a powerful API designed to analyze and modify the emotional tone of text inputs. It is built with a microservices architecture and leverages advanced natural language processing techniques and pre-trained models.

- **Documentation**: You can read the full API documentation here: [https://nicolas-sierralta.github.io/text_mood_processor/](https://nicolas-sierralta.github.io/text_mood_processor/)
- **Live Demo**: To see how the API works in action, visit: [https://www.text-mood-processor.live/](https://www.text-mood-processor.live/)

## Overview

The project is composed of the following microservices:

1. **API Gateway**: The central entry point that routes requests to the appropriate services.
2. **Tone Analyzer Service**: Analyzes the emotional tone of the provided text using a pre-trained GoEmotions model.
3. **Change Tone Service**: Changes the tone of the text using OpenAIâ€™s API.
4. **Model Inference Service**: Provides emotion inference on text, powered by the GoEmotions model.

The API offers a range of functionalities for real-time text analysis and modification, making it suitable for applications that need to adapt textual communication dynamically.

## Microservices and Endpoints

### 1. API Gateway

The API Gateway manages requests to the backend services.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/analyze-tone`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Analyzes the tone of the provided text.
  - **Request**: `{ "text": "Your text to analyze." }`

- **Endpoint**: `/api/change-tone`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Changes the tone of the provided text.
  - **Request**: `{ "text": "Your text", "target_tone": "desired tone" }`

- **Health Check**: `/health`

### 2. Tone Analyzer Service

- **Endpoint**: `/api/inference`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Performs emotion inference on the provided text.
  - **Request**: `{ "text": "Your text to analyze." }`

- **Endpoint**: `/api/analyze-tone`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Analyzes the tone of the provided text.

- **Health Check**: `/health`

### 3. Change Tone Service

- **Endpoint**: `/api/change-tone`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Changes the tone of the text to a specified tone.
  - **Request**: `{ "text": "Your text to modify.", "target_tone": "desired tone" }`

- **Health Check**: `/health`

### 4. Model Inference Service

- **Endpoint**: `/api/inference`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Performs emotion inference on the provided text using the GoEmotions model.
  - **Request**: `{ "text": "Your text to analyze." }`

- **Health Check**: `/health`

### CI/CD Pipeline
-------

The project uses a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the microservices. Key features include:

*   **Unit and Integration Tests**: Automatically run tests for each service using pytest.
    
*   **Docker**: Each service is containerized and pushed to GitHub Container Registry.
    
*   **Scaleway Deployment**: Deploys services to a Scaleway server after successful tests.
    
*   **MkDocs**: Documentation can be deployed using MkDocs with the option to trigger it through the workflow\_dispatch event.

### Workflow Dispatch for Documentation Deployment
-------
You can manually trigger the documentation deployment by selecting the mkdocs\_deploy job in GitHub Actions:

      deploy_mkdocs:  
        description: 'Deploy MkDocs documentation?'
        required: false
        default: 'false'
        type: choice
        options:
          - 'true'
          - 'false'

### Running Locally
---------------

To run the project locally, ensure Docker is installed and run the following commands:

- docker-compose up --build

This will start all services defined in docker-compose.yml.

### Testing
-------

Tests are written using pytest. To run the tests:

- pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings

### Documentation
Documentation is created using MkDocs. To serve the documentation locally:

- mkdocs serve
